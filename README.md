# SQL Project
This project contains SQL queries to explore data related to COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations. The queries are designed to provide insights into the pandemic's impact on different continents and countries.
## Queries
The following queries are included in the project:
* **Continent with highest death count:** This query returns the continent with the highest total number of COVID-19 deaths.
* **Total cases and deaths:** This query returns the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide.
* **Total population vs. total vaccination:** This query compares the total population of each continent to the total number of vaccinations administered.
* **Vaccination percentage:** This query calculates the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated in each continent.
## Setup
To run these queries, you will need to have a SQL database with the following tables:
* CovidDeaths: This table contains data on COVID-19 deaths by continent, country, and date.
* CovidVaccinations: This table contains data on COVID-19 vaccinations by continent, country, and date.
## Usage
To run a query, open the SQL file in a text editor and execute the query. The results of the query will be displayed in the output window.
